# Tower-of-Hanoi-Algo-Visualizer
This is a JavaFX application that visualizes the Tower of Hanoi algorithm. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
## Features
* The user can set the number of disks to be used in the puzzle.
* The user can visualize the algorithm in action.
* The user can see the number of moves required to complete the puzzle.
